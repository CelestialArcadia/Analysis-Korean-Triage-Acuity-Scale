Investigating the Efficacy of the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale

## Introduction

With the increasing utilization of emergency department (ED) services globally, there is a pressing need to reduce patient overcrowding, improve patient safety, and enhance the efficiency of emergency care [1]. Triage is a method that was implemented to improve the quality of emergency care by reducing patient length of stay, and is now commonly employed in EDs.

## Statement

The process of triage involves prioritizing patient treatment using a standardized 5-level system recognized internationally. The most widely used triage scales include the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), Canadian Triage and Acuity Scales (CTAS), Australian Triage Scale (ATS), and Manchester Triage Scale. However, it is important to note that triage scales should be adapted to the specific medical environment in which they are applied. Some countries have even modified major triage scales to fit their own medical settings.

In Korea, various tools such as CTAS, ESI, ATS, and a triage scale based on the Korean Emergency Medical Service Act were used in 97.1% of tertiary hospitals and regional emergency medical centers in 2012. However, the different triage scales led to communication difficulties among EDs. Thus, a standardized triage system was needed, and the Korean Triage and Acuity Scales (KTAS), based on the CTAS, was developed and implemented nationwide in 2016.

The accuracy of triage is crucial for ensuring patient safety and reducing ED overcrowding. Mistriage can lead to longer stays in the ED and increased patient mortality. Overtriage, or overestimating patients with low severity conditions, can also result in increased resource consumption, ED overcrowding, and longer stays, which ultimately leads to a lack of medical resources in the ED. Therefore, evaluating the accuracy of triage and identifying the causes of mistriage are essential for improving patient safety and the quality of emergency care.
